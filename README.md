Problem statement: Create an analytical project to explore and optimize the e-commerce ecosystem. The project aims to analyze product performance by tracking sales, categories, sub-categories, and manufacturer 
details. Customer insights will be derived by segmenting data based on regions, zip codes, and purchasing behavior. Orders will be analyzed to monitor delivery timelines, shipping modes, and statuses, helping
to identify inefficiencies in the supply chain. Transactions will be assessed for revenue, discount patterns, and profit margins to improve financial decision-making. Return reasons and customer reviews will
provide actionable insights to enhance product quality and service. The goal is to deliver a comprehensive dashboard that enables data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction, streamline operations,
and drive profitability.
